    <p>Classic colonial charm meets modern-day updates at 707 Forest Glen. Follow the driveway to a welcoming flagstone path and step inside this south-facing home filled with natural light and beautiful hardwood floors. The living room features a wood-burning fireplace, recessed lighting, and a warm, inviting feel. The fully renovated kitchen offers an open floor plan to the dining room with quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, and custom cabinetry which is perfect for everyday living and entertaining. A spacious yet cozy family room sits just off the living room, and a convenient half bath completes the main level. </p>
    <p>Upstairs, hardwood floors continue into three generously sized bedrooms, each with custom closet storage, along with a stunning renovated full bath and access to attic storage. The finished lower level provides additional living space, a full bathroom, storage room, walk-out access to the backyard, and entry to the attached garage which is rare for Silver Spring. Enjoy outdoor living on the flagstone patio overlooking an expansive, private, grassy backyard. Ideally located just moments from Four Corners shops, downtown Silver Spring, I-495, and Kensington.</p>
    <p>Life at 707 Forest Glen extends well beyond the front door. It is a neighborhood where community is part of the rhythm of everyday life. Summers bring block parties, fall means neighborhood-wide Halloween celebrations, and the South Four Corners Civic Association keeps the calendar full with events throughout the year. One of the most beloved traditions is the Porch Music Fest, when neighbors perform on their front lawns and the entire area comes together for a festival-like afternoon. Getting outside is effortless as Sligo Creek Park is just a short walk away, quickly becoming part of your daily routine with morning runs, after-dinner strolls, or quiet weekend resets. Nearby parks and playgrounds make it easy to fit in fresh air and playtime without planning ahead. When summer evenings arrive, the neighborhood truly shines. Sligo Golf Course hosts free concerts every Friday night throughout the summer and into early fall, one of those simple joys that makes you feel especially lucky to live nearby.</p>
